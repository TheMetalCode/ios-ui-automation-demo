# iOS XCTest UI Automation Demo

A complement to [my Mobile Dev+Test 2016 presentation](https://mobiledevtest.techwell.com/program/concurrent-sessions/scalable-and-collaborative-ios-ui-test-automation-swift) and a tangible demonstration of the basic concepts covered therein.

## Calculator Tab

This is most of the work for programming projects #1-3 in the Stanford iTunesU course ["Developing iOS 8 Apps with Swift"](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-8-apps-swift/id961180099). It also is a good opportunity to demonstrate basic drag-and-drop UI elements that have accessibility ids added via the storyboard. And lastly, the benefit of well-factored test automation code is readily apparent, because there are lots of buttons.

## Picture Cells

This is a table view with tappable cells, an opportunity to demonstrate setting accessibility ids programmatically in the view controller code.

## UI Tests Folder

This is where you'll find the XCTest cases as well as all the supporting code behind them (Screen Objects, extensions, protocols, etc).

## Usage

- Ensure you have XCode 7.0+
- Clone this repo
- Open in XCode, and give the tests a spin with Cmd + U.
- Explore and tinker to your hearts content.
